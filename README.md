### Design
* The world is generated through a matrix using "createElement" function. Each number in the matrix has its own data-type and tile-image from the minecraft game.
* Each tool can "destroy" a different tiles n the grid and send it to the inventory.
* Clicking the inventory allows to re-build the tile back into the world anywhere on the game grid.

### Technology used
* This game was build in vanilla JavaScript
* The game is fully responsive.
